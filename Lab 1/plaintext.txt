A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are each asked to prove the assertion that all odd numbers greater than one are prime. The mathematician says three is prime five is prime seven is prime and so by mathematical induction all odd numbers greater than one are prime. The physicist says three is prime five is prime seven is prime nine is an experimental error eleven is prime and so yes all odd numbers greater than one are prime. The engineer says three is prime five is prime seven is prime nine is prime eleven is prime thirteen is prime fifteen is prime...
